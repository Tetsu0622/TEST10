How to make a D-STAR parrot?


One of the ways to try out the capabilities of the GMSKmodem is to use it for a GMSK "simplex repeater"
(also known as a "parrot").


* Download and compile the gmskmodem from github:
https://github.com/on1arf/gmsk

* create an new directory (e.g. called "echo")
- in that directory, create another directory "done"


* start TWO bash sessions:

- In the first session, start the gmskmodem.

These are the options I use on the friendlyarm mini2440 are:
gmskmodem -format d -sit 12345 -soa hw:1 -ria hw:1 -rof echotest -ptt_tx /dev/ttySAC0

-> -format d		: read and write files in the "DVTOOL" format

-> -sit 12345		: GMSK SENDER INPUT: TCP port 12345
(i.e. the gmsksender will listen on tcp port 12345 and exect data to be send out on that port)
-> -soa hw:1		: GMSK SENDER OUTPUT: ALSA device hw:1 (which is in my case a USB audio-dongle)

-> -ria hw:1		: GMSK RECEIVER INPUT: ALSA device hw:1 (same dongle as used for audio out)
-> -rof echotest	: GMSK RECEIVER OUTPUT: FILES "echotest"
(the information received by the modem will be writen to files called echotest-0000.dvtool; where
the 4-digit number will go up for every file)

-ptt_tx /dev/ttySAC0
						: GMSK SENDER PTT driver: serial device /dev/ttySAC0
(use either the options ptt_tx, ptt_cs or ptt_lf as needed on your board. Do "gmskmodem -h" for
more info).



- In the 2nd session, start run the "echo-dvtool.sh" bash-script.

This script will
- check every second if new audio files have been created by the gmskmodem
- if found, send it back to the gmskmodem using "nc" (netcat). Afterwards, the file will be moved
to the "done" directory.




Feel free to give it a try!
